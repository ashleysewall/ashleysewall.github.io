            <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
            <p>As a part of the School of Communication's honor program at the University of Miami, I was able to work with my advisor to design my own major. Together, we crafted a graphic design major tailored to my interests in strategic communications. My classes span advertising, journalism and public relations graphic design classes. Through my extracurriculars, I am able to practice my skills and continue to build on my portfolio. In the fall I will be the Vice Chair of Hurricane Productions, overseeing the marketing for one of the largest organizations at the University of Miami.</p>

                <h2>Rebranding Project: American Music Therapy Association</h2>
                <p>In my class, we were tasked with rebranding a nonprofit organization of our choice. I chose to do the American Music Therapy Association as I grew up playing the piano and flute. For this project, I developed logo variations, merchandise mock-ups and more using predominantly Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.</p>

            <h2>Design Campaign: Euphoria</h2>
            <p>As part of an advertising design final, I was tasked with choosing a movie, television show, musical or musical artist to create campaign materials for. I chose the popular show, Euphoria, as my muse and designed posters, billboards and merchandise using predominantly Adobe Photoshop.</p>
