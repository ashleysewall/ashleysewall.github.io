            <h1>Journalism</h1>
            <p>Journalism has always been a passion of mine, likely due to my love of reading. I spent my second year of college working as the Copy Chief of The Miami Hurricane, the school newspaper of the University of Miami. In this role, I read through articles before publication and edited them thoroughly, learning more about journalistic writing and AP Style. Later, I began to write for the paper in the news section, especially enjoying breaking news. Next school year I will be one of the two co-News Editors of the paper.</p>

            <h2>Fulbright event educates students about funded research opportunities</h2>

            <h2><a href="https://themiamihurricane.com/2024/02/29/sigma-alpha-epsilon-faces-hazing-allegations-after-video-surfaces/">Sigma Alpha Epsilon Faces Hazing Allegations After Video Surfaces</a></h2>
            <p>Late one night, The Miami Hurricane received a video of alleged hazing at one of the University of Miami fraternities. I, along with two of my coworkers at The Hurricane, helped investigate the validity of this video and put together the article, the first to break the news publicly. After publishing, we were approached by CBS 4 Miami about referencing our article and were also referenced on The Miami Herald.</p>

            <h2>The Israel, Gaza conflict and its effect on the University of Miami community</h2>
            <p>For one of my journalism classes, our final project was to put together an article prominent to the University of Miami community. The topic I chose was the Israel and Gaza conflict as that was a hot topic at the time. I did thorough research into the history and contacted students and faculty who supported both sides. The University of Miami has a high Jewish population, and so my goal was to shed light on both sides to ensure proper representation, which I struggled to see at the time.</p>
