            <h2>Public Relations</h2>
            <p>Entering college, I knew I wanted to study public relations, and in my time at the University of Miami, I have explored everything which goes into the practice.</p>

            <h3>Miami Hurricanes Football</h3>
            <p>In one of my PR writing classes, we spent the semester working with a client of our choosing and developing a media kit for them. I decided to work with the University of Miami football team, crafting a backgrounder, fact sheet, news release and more seen below. This experience gave me a look into the fast-paced environment of PR, especially sports PR, and taught me how to build documents necessary for a media kit.</p>

            <h3>Pollinator Protection Program</h3>
            <p>Our final project for my strategic planning course was to develop a strategic PR plan for a client: Pollinator Partnership, the non-profit arm of Burt's Bees. In a team of three, my colleagues and I developed a PR campaign plan to launch the Florida Bee Buffer Project with a budget of $10.</p>

            <h4>Brandy Melville Research</h4>
            <p>For my PR research class, my classmates and I were separated into groups to do research into a company of our choosing throughout the semester. My group chose Brandy Melville to delve into the controversies they face and the effect they may or may not have on consumers. We performed a situational analysis, conduced interviews and focus groups, and sent out a survey. Our target audience for the project was female college students. We analyzed our findings with SPSS 28 software.</p>
