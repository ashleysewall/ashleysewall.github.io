            <h2>Public Relations</h2>
            <p>Entering college, I knew I wanted to study public relations, and in my time at the University of Miami, I have explored everything which goes into the practice.</p>

                <h3>Miami Hurricanes Football</h3>
                <p>In one of my PR writing classes, we spent the semester working with a client of our choosing and developing a media kit for them. I decided to work with the University of Miami football team, crafting a backgrounder, fact sheet, news release and more seen below. This experience gave me a look into the fast-paced environment of PR, especially sports PR, and taught me how to build documents necessary for a media kit.</p>

            <h3>Pollinator Protection Program</h3>
            <p>Our final project for my strategic planning course was to develop a strategic PR plan for a client: Pollinator Partnership, the non-profit arm of Burt's Bees. In a team of three, my colleagues and I developed a PR campaign plan to launch the Florida Bee Buffer Project with a budget of $10.</p>
